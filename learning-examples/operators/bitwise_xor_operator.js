/* The bitwise XOR (^) operator returns a 1 in each bit position
 * for which the corresponding bits of either, but not both, operands are 1.*/

let a = 5;
let b = 3;
console.log(a ^ b);

// The result is 6 (110 in binary) because the first and second bits from the right are different in the two numbers
