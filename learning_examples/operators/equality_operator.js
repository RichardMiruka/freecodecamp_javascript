// equality operator ( == )
// Type coercion done here  to check if each value is equal.

console.log(5 == "5");

//JavaScript converts the string "5" into the number 5 and then checks if they are equal.
// Since both values are now the same, the result is true. 
// The equality operator uses type coercion before checking if each value is equal.
